            <h2>Why Spain?</h2>
            <br><p>Spain is a very popular tourist destination with over 31.2 million<br> international tourists visiting each year. It is also the 2nd most<br> visited country in the world. For thousands of years Spain has been one of the cultural centers<br> of Europe known for tapas, sunshine, beaches, Flamenco<br> dancing, music and bullfights. From the dramatic, imposing<br> mountains to the countless glistening beaches that dot its<br> coastlines, Spain is a country full of natural beauty<br> and inspiring landscapes. In my site, you can discover more about <br>Spanish traditions and culture, as well as the geographic wonders in Spain.

          <p>Madrid is the capital of Spain, and is home to the Spanish Royal family as well as the Spanish Government. It is a modern metropolitan city and an economical and industrial center of Spain, and, with its population of nearly 3,5 million people, is also the biggest city in Spain. Although it is located in the centre of the country, it has traditionally been the hub between different areas of Spain and is therefore connected to all major Spanish cities by train, road or air. The weather in Madrid varies a lot depending on the season, from hot and dry in the summer and with some rain in the winter.</p>
